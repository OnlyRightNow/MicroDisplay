2. To be honest, Marc is not often in the group, he is mostly at microsoft. Most of the exchange and coordination is done by a very senior post-doc, Martin Oswald.

The physics-property dataset is a project where many people of the lab are very interested in, since it would allow many new things. At the same time some are currently thinking of extending the ETH3D dataset, and this could maybe even be added as well.
